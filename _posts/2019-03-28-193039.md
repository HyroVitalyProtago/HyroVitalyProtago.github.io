user_text: 'Twitter, if I need an XR engineer/designer hybrid, someone who is a fantastic designer but also has the engineering chops to bring their own, and others visions to life, what is that called? (This is not an artist role.)'

@timoni 100% both? So a profile like @keiichiban or @MrSchubert . Don't know a lot of profiles like that... 
If I need to completely subjectively rank myself, I'm probably 100% engineer / 70% interaction designer... Don't know if there is actually some schools that teach both equally.
