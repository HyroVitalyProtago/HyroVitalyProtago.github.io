user_text: 'Twitter, if I need an XR engineer/designer hybrid, someone who is a fantastic designer but also has the engineering chops to bring their own, and others visions to life, what is that called? (This is not an artist role.)'

@timoni Is design about interaction design ? If so, you search an XR Interaction (or UX) designer+engineer. (replace engineer with developer and you have an XR Interaction Prototyper). The real question is : more a designer or an engineer ?
