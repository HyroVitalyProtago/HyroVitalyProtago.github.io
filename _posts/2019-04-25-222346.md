user_text: 'How do you, personally, distinguish between AR, MR, XR, smart glasses, and video pass-through VR?  What are your takes on the distinctions between them?  Which one do you look most forward to using?'

@tiltfive AR: reality augmented with virtual things
MR: 50/50 virtual/real (middle of virtual real continuum and not the marketing from Microsoft)
XR: shorcut for ARVR = spatial computing
Smart glasses: basic AR overlay
VR pass-through: Immersive AR
