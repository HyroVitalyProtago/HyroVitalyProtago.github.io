user_text: 'What content on the Quest was impossible so far because of wires?

I see plenty of cool ports including <a href="/tiltbrush" class="twitter-atreply pretty-link js-nav" dir="ltr" data-mentioned-user-id="2946570168"><s>@</s><b>tiltbrush</b></a> but arguably none so far required to be wireless.

Anything requiring very large areas or movements like jumping and turning a lot that benefit from being wireless?'

@utopiah @tiltbrush Nice, I remember this tweet! And there will be dedicated content, mostly sports games like tennis, volley ball, basket ball, handball, etc... And probably new sports created for the spatial computing like tron disk battle.
