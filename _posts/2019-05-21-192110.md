user_text: 'What content on the Quest was impossible so far because of wires?

I see plenty of cool ports including <a href="/tiltbrush" class="twitter-atreply pretty-link js-nav" dir="ltr" data-mentioned-user-id="2946570168"><s>@</s><b>tiltbrush</b></a> but arguably none so far required to be wireless.

Anything requiring very large areas or movements like jumping and turning a lot that benefit from being wireless?'
