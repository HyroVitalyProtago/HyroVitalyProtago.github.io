I really like all the ecosystem of the [IndieWeb](https://indieweb.org/) ([IndieAuth](https://indieweb.org/IndieAuth), [POSSE](https://indieweb.org/POSSE), [Microsub](https://indieweb.org/Microsub), [Micropub](https://indieweb.org/Micropub), [Webmention](https://webmention.net/)). But self-hosting is still a problem for users...

I also love all the work around [IPFS](https://ipfs.io/) and [DAT](https://dat-ecosystem.org/) protocols for a fully decentralized web with new browsers as [Aggregor](https://agregore.mauve.moe/) from [Ranger Mauve](https://ranger.mauve.moe/) and [Beaker](https://beakerbrowser.com/). But I'm not sure about its compatibility with [WebXR](https://immersive-web.github.io/webxr/)... it's a lot of work to implements as it can be seen with the XR browser [Wolvic](https://wolvic.org/), fork of [Firefox Reality (RIP)](https://mixedreality.mozilla.org/firefox-reality/) by [Igalia](https://www.igalia.com/).

Nevertheless, each day, I discover a new web more decentralized that I love more and more based on [WebSocket](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSockets_API), [WebRTC](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebRTC_API) and [WebTorrent](https://webtorrent.io/). Each time, I think about how the immersive-web and the "metaverse" need this as a base to reach its full potential and avoid a meta-dystopia.

Some useful resources:
- [Secure Scuttlebutt (SSB)](https://ssbc.github.io/scuttlebutt-protocol-guide/): a protocol for a p2p database with some existing [apps](http://scuttlebot.io/apps/index.html) based on it.
- [Bugout](https://github.com/chr15m/bugout/): Browser-to-browser networking built on WebTorrent.
- [Gun](https://github.com/amark/gun):
    - Multiplayer by default with realtime p2p state synchronization!
    - Graph data let's you use key/value, tables, documents, videos, & more!
    - Local-first, offline, and decentralized with end-to-end encryption.
- [OrbitDB](https://orbitdb.org/): serverless, distributed, peer-to-peer database. OrbitDB uses IPFS as its data storage and IPFS Pubsub to automatically sync databases with peers. Itâ€™s an eventually consistent database that uses CRDTs for conflict-free database merges.
- [Ink and Switch](https://www.inkandswitch.com/): articles on experiments for p2p web/apps
- [Gun vs. OrbitDB vs. SSB (Nov 27, 2018)](https://medium.com/3box/3box-research-comparing-distributed-databases-gun-orbitdb-and-scuttlebutt-2e3b5da34ef3): many things may have changed over the past few years.
