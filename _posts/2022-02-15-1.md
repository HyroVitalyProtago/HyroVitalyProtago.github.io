I really like all the ecosystem of the [IndieWeb](https://indieweb.org/) ([IndieAuth](https://indieweb.org/IndieAuth), [POSSE](https://indieweb.org/POSSE), [Microsub](https://indieweb.org/Microsub), [Micropub](https://indieweb.org/Micropub), [Webmention](https://webmention.net/)). But self-hosting is still a problem for users...

I also love all the work around [IPFS](https://ipfs.io/) and [DAT](https://dat-ecosystem.org/) protocols for a fully decentralized web with new browsers as [Aggregor](https://agregore.mauve.moe/) from [Ranger Mauve](https://ranger.mauve.moe/) and [Beaker](https://beakerbrowser.com/). But I'm not sure about its compatibility with [WebXR](https://immersive-web.github.io/webxr/)... it's a lot of work to implements as it can be seen with the XR browser [Wolvic](https://wolvic.org/), fork of [Firefox Reality (RIP)](https://mixedreality.mozilla.org/firefox-reality/) by [Igalia](https://www.igalia.com/).

Nevertheless, each day, I discover a new web more decentralized that I love more and more based on [WebSocket](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSockets_API), [WebRTC](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebRTC_API) and [WebTorrent](https://webtorrent.io/). Each time, I think about how the immersive-web and the "metaverse" need this as a base to reach its full potential.

Some useful resources:
- [Secure Scuttlebutt](https://ssbc.github.io/scuttlebutt-protocol-guide/): a protocol for a p2p database with existing [apps](http://scuttlebot.io/apps/index.html) to use it for p2p social-media.
- [Bugout](https://github.com/chr15m/bugout/): Browser-to-browser networking built on WebTorrent.
- [Gun](https://github.com/amark/gun):
    - Multiplayer by default with realtime p2p state synchronization!
    - Graph data let's you use key/value, tables, documents, videos, & more!
    - Local-first, offline, and decentralized with end-to-end encryption.
- [Ink and Switch](https://www.inkandswitch.com/): articles on experiments for p2p web/apps
