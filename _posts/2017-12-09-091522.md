user_text: 'What do you consider “working hard”? 

(Want to know: when you say you’re working hard, or others are: how long? How much? On what? Not interested in: opinions on work/life balance, normal workweek defenses, etc, etc.)'

@timoni It's a question of personal high intensity (cognitive and/or physical). If it's sufficiently long in terms of time, there is some fatigue after the task because you was completely invested.
You working hard when you can't do better in the same context.
